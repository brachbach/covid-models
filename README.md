# Why are these programs the (weird) way they are?

They're meant to be "runnable psuedocode"

I wanted to make sure they:
- had decompositional structure
- had as little extraneous code as possible
- were as readable as possible to an audience most familiar with Python

I think the weird-formatted JS I used is pretty well-suited to this, better than actual Python
